    ### A hyphen before a property name indicates that a new list element is starting. 
    ### The following properties are required:
    # Path to Frictionless Resource descriptor file
  - resource_file_path: ./assets/output_data/qcew_annual_long_summarized_{variable}.resource.yaml
    # Short, descriptive title for the dataset
    title: Quarterly Census of Employment and Wage, individual variable measurement (long form)
    # Short description of the item that provides people information they can scan at a glance. 2,048 characters max.
    summary: 
    # ISO8601-compliant string representing the date or datetime that best describes the facts included in the dataset
    # reference_date:
